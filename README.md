# TayyabJaved.com
This is my personal portfolio website, the code is available for free for review and to use in your own projects.

>Will at a licence file soon to this project.

## Technology
* The websites backend is made with Go. 
* HTML,CSS (TailwindCss)


## Why iI Chosose Go
>- Because its damn fast, and because i wanted something that didnt use javascript. I wanted to use a pure backend system to make a website because i wanted good maintenance and didn't want to maintain a backend api and a front end website. 
>- Web Scrapping is very fast with Go, Since my website also pulls prayer times from different websites, i wanted to showcase my Go skills features such as channels, wait groups and Go routines to quickly pull data from different websites and palce them in a nice Uk. Example would be tayyabjaved.com/bcm
